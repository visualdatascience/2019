bio: |
    Pat Hanrahan is a computer graphics researcher, the Canon Professor of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering in the Computer Graphics Laboratory at Stanford University. He is also Tableauâ€™s Chief Scientist. 
    His current research involves rendering algorithms, high performance graphics architectures, and systems support for graphical interaction. He also has worked on raster graphics systems, computer animation and modeling and scientific visualization, in particular, volume rendering. Before joining Stanford he was a faculty member at Princeton.

    Pat has also worked at Pixar where he developed volume rendering software and was the chief architect of the RenderMan Interface - a protocol that allows modeling programs to describe scenes to high quality rendering programs. Pat has received three Academy Awards for Science and Technology, the Spirit of America Creativity Award, the SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics Achievement Award, the SIGGRAPH Stephen A. Coons Award, and the IEEE Visualization Career Award. 


abstract: |
    There have been great advances in machine learning lately, in particular, deep learning. The result has been even more intelligent systems, such as image recognition, AlphaGo and self-driving cars. The technologies of machine learning are similar in many ways to those used in statistical data analysis. So, a natural question is - can AI be applied to analysis? That is, can people doing analysis be replaced by automated systems? In this talk, I will explore this question.
