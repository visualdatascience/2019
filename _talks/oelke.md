abstract: |
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is on the rise all around us. On the one hand, we love it, because it enables services and features that would not be possible without it. On the other hand, we fear it because of the lack of transparency that these systems often entail despite the huge impact they can have.  
    <br>
    In my talk, I am going to give you an introduction to the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) which aims at providing transparency for AI systems. I will also share my experiences with employing Explainable AI in an industrial setting. Besides, I am going to exemplify the value of visualization for Explainable AI and highlight what role we as a visualization community can play in shaping the future of applied Artificial Intelligence.
