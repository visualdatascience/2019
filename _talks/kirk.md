abstract: |
    Since Michael Lewis published “Moneyball” in 2003, sports discourse has become increasingly more analytical and data driven. However, only recently is it becoming properly visual. The intersection of visualization and sports analytics is a truly exciting place in 2018, and this presentation describes how and why visualization is uniquely equipped to reform and reshape sports discourse forever.  
    <br />
    
    The presentation includes two sections.  First, we investigate how visualization has helped shaped new analytical awakenings in professional basketball this decade and how those awakenings are reshaping the entire aesthetic of the sport.  Recent visual advances in basketball analytics have enabled the construction and dissemination of new knowledge centered around the key interactions between performance and space in the NBA. In turn, organizations are responding by altering in-game strategies, player valuations, and player development protocols.

    Second, we examine the relatively slow adoption of visual analytics in the sports world. Despite the massive appetite for insights about athletes and teams, pro sports have generally been slow to leverage the immense opportunities visual analytics provide. Why is this? One reason is the simple lack of available data; however, that’s not all. In many cases, available data exists for years before powerful visual treatments are leveraged. This lag is both fascinating and important to investigate in part because it is by no means unique to the sports industry. We conclude with the identification of key concepts that will guide the future interactions between sports and visual data science.
