The workshop will feature a series of keynote presentations by leading data scientists covering general challenges and visualization in data science. **In addition, there will be presentations by speakers selected from submitted papers and abstracts.**

## Papers


Paper submissions should describe the role, application, and impact of visualization in data science. We would like to particularly encourage papers that cross disciplinary boundaries and show how visualization in data science can be a catalyst for discovery. Papers will be published in our symposium proceedings and published in the IEEE Digital Library.  We consider papers as work in progress and encourage authors to publish an improved version of the paper in a journal or at another venue at a later time.  In addition, we plan to publish extended versions of selected papers in a special issue of the [IEEE Transactions on Big Data](https://www.computer.org/web/tbd) (pending approval).

Papers that integrate visualization with any stages of the data science pipeline (collecting data, cleaning data, exploring data, and communicating data) would be welcome as submissions to VDS.  


### Review Process

Paper submissions will be managed by the Program Chairs and sent to the Program Committee to evaluate the work’s novelty and significance. You have the option to have your work reviewed via a double-blind process; to do this, simply be sure to exclude all identifying information in the submitted manuscript file, ensuring that the reviewers will not know the identify of the authors. Otherwise, the review process will be single-blind, i.e., the reviewers will know the identity of the authors, but the authors will not know the identity of the reviewers.


### Paper Submission and Formatting Guidelines


Submissions should be no more than 8 pages long — shorter papers are welcome — and formatted according to the [VGTC formatting guidelines](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html).

To submit a paper please use the [Precision Conference System](https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions). After logging in go to “new submissions” and select “Submit to Papers” for VDS 2018.


## Abstracts / Talks

Abstract submissions should be one page and describe the role, application, and impact of visualization in data science. We would like to particularly encourage **abstracts that cross disciplinary boundaries and show how visualization in data science can be a catalyst for discovery.**


There are three possibilities to contribute to the program at VDS:

 1. **New Research:** Participants are invited to submit an abstract describing interesting work in progress research. 
 2. **Highlights:** Participants are encouraged to submit an abstract describing their recently published work related to visualization in data science.
 3. **Position Statements:** We encourage submissions discussing, e.g., the role of data science in general, the relationship of visualization and data science, considerations regarding data science education, etc.  

The authors of accepted abstracts will be invited to give a talk at VDS. While abstracts can have multiple authors, we assume that only one author will speak (contact us post-acceptance if multiple authors of one submission want to speak). Speakers, their biography, and the abstract will be published on the symposium website.

### Review Process

Each abstract submission will be read and evaluated by the chairs for quality and relevance to VDS with the goal of being as inclusive as possible and encouraging cross-domain interactions. Brief feedback will be provided as needed to support acceptance decisions, but authors should not expect detailed reviews. Authors will be required to prepare a revision if the chairs note so in their feedback statements.

### Submission and Formatting Guidelines

Formatting is informal, we encourage creativity. Please limit your abstract to one page. For the abstract, only PDF files are acceptable. Please ensure to include in the document:

 * a concise description of the talk content,
 * a picture showing an application of visualization in data science (not necessary for position statements),
 * for previously published work: a reference to the original paper.

To submit a paper please use the [Precision Conference System](https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions). After logging in go to "new submissions" and select "Submit to Abstracts/Talks" for VDS 2018.
